## AFP

**General Option**

| | |
|-|-|
| Database Path | Sets the database information to be stored in the path. The path must be writable even if the pool is read only. |

**Access**

| | |
|-|-|
| Guest Account | Select an account to use for guest access. This account must have permissions to the shared pool or dataset. The privileges given to this user are also available to any client connecting to the guest service. This user must exist in the password file, but does not require a valid login. The root user cannot be used as guest account. |
| Guest Access | Set to disable the password prompt that appears before clients access AFP shares. |
| Max Connections | Maximum number of simultaneous connections permitted via AFP. The default limit is 50. |
| Chmod Request | Indicates how to handle Access Control Lists. Ignore: ignores requests and gives the parent directory ACL inheritance full control over new items. Preserve: preserves ZFS ACEs for named users and groups or the POSIX ACL group mask. Simple: is set to chmod() as requested without any extra steps. |
| Map ACLs | Select mapping of permissions for authenticated users. Rights (default, Unix-style permissions), None, or Mode (ACLs). |

**Other Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| Log Level | Record AFP service messages up to the specified log level in the system log. By default, severe and warning level messages are logged. |
| Bind Interfaces | Specify the IP addresses to listen for AFP connections. Leave blank to bind to all available IPs. If none are specified, advertise the first IP address of the system, but listen for any incoming request. |
| Global Auxilliary | Additional [afp.conf(5)](http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/3.0/htmldocs/afp.conf.5.html) parameters. |

## Dynamic DNS

**General Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| Provider | Several providers are supported. If a specific provider is not listed, select Custom Provider and enter the information in the Custom Server and Custom Path fields. |
| CheckIP-Server SSL | Use HTTPS for the connection to the CheckIP Server. |
| CheckIP Server | Name and port of the server that reports the external IP address. For example, entering checkip.dyndns.org:80 uses [Dyn IP detection](https://help.dyn.com/remote-access-api/checkip-tool/). to discover the remote socket IP address. |
| CheckIP Path | Path to the CheckIP Server. For example, no-ip.com uses a CheckIP Server of dynamic.zoneedit.com and CheckIP Path of /checkip.html. |
| SSL | Use HTTPS for the connection to the server that updates the DNS record. |
| Domain Name | Fully qualified domain name of the host with the dynamic IP address. Separate multiple domains with a space, comma (,), or semicolon (;). Example: myname.dyndns.org; myothername.dyndns.org. |
| Update Period | How often the IP is checked in seconds. |

**Credentials**

| | |
|-|-|
| Username | Username for logging in to the provider and updating the record. |
| Password | Password for logging in to the provider and updating the record. |

## FTP

**General Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| Port | Set the port the FTP service listens on. |
| Clients | The maximum number of simultaneous clients. |
| Connections | Set the maximum number of connections per IP address. 0 means unlimited. |
| Login Attempts | Enter the maximum number of attempts before client is disconnected. Increase this if users are prone to typos. |
| Timeout | Maximum client idle time in seconds before client is disconnected. |
| Certificate | The SSL certificate to be used for TLS FTP connections. To create a certificate, use System --> Certificates. |

**Advanced**

| | |
|-|-|
| Access | When set, a local user is only allowed access to their home directory if they are a member of the wheel group. |
| Always Chroot | Setting this option is discouraged as it increases security risk. |
| Allow Root Login | Allow anonymous FTP logins with access to the directory specified in Path. |
| Allow Anonymous Login | Allow any local user to log in. By default, only members of the ftp group are allowed to log in. |
| Allow Local User Login | Setting this option will result in timeouts if identd is not running on the client. |
| Require IDENT Authentication | Sets default permissions for newly created files. |
| File Permissionshelp_outline | Sets default permissions for newly created directories. |

**TLS**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enable TLS | Allow encrypted connections. Requires a certificate created or imported with the System > Certificates menu. |
| TLS Policy | Define whether the control channel, data channel, both channels, or neither channel of an FTP session must occur over SSL/TLS. The policies are described [here](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/directives/linked/config_ref_TLSRequired.html). |
| TLS Allow Client Renegotiations | Setting this option is not recommended as it breaks several security measures. Refer to [mod_tls](http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_tls.html) for more details. |
| TLS Allow Dot Login | If set, the user home directory is checked for a .tlslogin file which contains one or more PEM-encoded certificates. If not found, the user is prompted for password authentication. |
| TLS Allow Per User | If set, the password of the user can be sent unencrypted. |
| TLS Common Name Required | When set, the common name in the certificate must match the FQDN of the host. |
| TLS Enable Diagnostics | If set when troubleshooting a connection, logs more verbosely. |
| TLS Export Certificate Data | Set to export the certificate environment variables. |
| TLS No Certificate Request | Set if the client cannot connect, and it is suspected the client is poorly handling the server certificate request. |
| TLS No Empty Fragments | Enabling this option is not recommended as it bypasses a security mechanism. |
| TLS No Session Reuse Required | Setting this option reduces the security of the connection, so only use it if the client does not understand reused SSL sessions. |
| TLS Export Standard Vars | If selected, sets several environment variables. |
| TLS DNS Name Required | If set, the DNS name of the client must resolve to its IP address and the cert must contain the same DNS name. |
| TLS IP Address Required | If set, the client certificate must contain the IP address that matches the IP address of the client. |

| Maximum Passive Port * | Used by clients in PASV mode. A default of 0 means any port above 1023. |
| Enable FXP | Set to enable the File eXchange Protocol. This option makes the server vulnerable to FTP bounce attacks so it is not recommended. |
| Allow Transfer Resumption | Set to allow FTP clients to resume interrupted transfers. |
| Perform Reverse DNS Lookups | Set to perform reverse DNS lookups on client IPs. This can cause long delays if reverse DNS is not configured. |
| Masquerade Address | Public IP address or hostname. Set if FTP clients cannot connect through a NAT device. |

| Logical Block Size | Leave at the default of 512 unless the initiator requires a different block size. |
| Disable Physical Block Size Reporting | Set if the initiator does not support physical block size values over 4K (MS SQL). |
| Enable TPC | Set to allow an initiator to bypass normal access control and access any scannable target. This allows xcopy operations which are otherwise blocked by access control. |
| Xen initiator compat mode | Set when using Xen as the iSCSI initiator. |
| LUN RPM | Do NOT change this setting when using Windows as the initiator. Only needs to be changed in large environments where the number of systems using a specific RPM is needed for accurate reporting statistics. |

| Guest Account | Account to be used for guest access. Default is nobody. The chosen account is required to have permissions to the shared pool or dataset. To adjust permissions, edit the dataset Access Control List (ACL), add a new entry for the chosen guest account, and configure the permissions in that entry. If the selected Guest Account is deleted the field resets to nobody. |

| Weak Ciphers | WARNING: these ciphers are considered security vulnerabilities and should only be allowed in a secure network environment. |
| Auxiliary Parameters | Add any more [sshd_config(5)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sshd_config) options not covered in this screen. Enter one option per line. These options are case-sensitive. Misspellings can prevent the SSH service from starting. |

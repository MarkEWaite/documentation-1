## General 

**GUI**

| | |
|-|-|
| GUI SSL Certificate | The system uses a self-signed certificate to enable encrypted web interface connections. To change the default certificate, select a different certificate that was created or imported in the **Certificates** menu. |
| Web Interface IPv4 Address | Choose a recent IP address to limit the usage when accessing the administrative GUI. The built-in HTTP server binds to the wildcard address of 0.0.0.0 (any address) and issues an alert if the specified address becomes unavailable. |
| Web Interface IPv6 Address | Choose a recent IPv6 address to limit the usage when accessing the administrative GUI. The built-in HTTP server binds to the wildcard address of 0.0.0.0 (any address) and issues an alert if the specified address becomes unavailable. |
| Web Interface HTTP Port | Allow configuring a non-standard port to access the GUI over HTTP. Changing this setting might require changing a [Firefox configuration setting](https://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~d_fens/articles/Firefox:_This_Address_is_Restricted). |
| Web Interface HTTPS Port | Allow configuring a non-standard port to access the GUI over HTTPS. |
| HTTPS Protocols | Cryptographic protocols for securing client/server connections. Select which [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) versions TrueNAS can use for connection security. |
| Web Interface HTTP -> HTTPS Redirect | Redirect HTTP connections to HTTPS. A GUI SSL Certificate is required for HTTPS. Activating this also sets the [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) maximum age to 31536000 seconds (one year). This means that after a browser connects to the web interface for the first time, the browser continues to use HTTPS and renews this setting every year. |

**Localization**

| | |
|-|-|
| Language | Select a language from the drop-down menu. |
| Date Format | Choose a date format. |
| Console Keyboard Map | Select a keyboard layout. |
| Timezone | Select a time zone. |
| Time Format | Choose a time format. |

**Other Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| Crash reporting | Send failed HTTP request data which can include client and server IP addresses, failed method call tracebacks, and middleware log file contents to iXsystems. |
| Usage collection | Enable sending anonymous usage statistics to iXsystems. |

## NTP Servers: Add or Edit

**NTP Server Settings**

| | |
|-|-|
| Address | Enter the hostname or IP address of the NTP server. |
| Burst | Recommended when Max. Poll is greater than 10. Only use on personal NTP servers or those under direct control. Do not enable when using public NTP servers. |
| IBurst | Speeds up the initial synchronization (seconds instead of minutes). |
| Prefer | Should only be used for highly accurate NTP servers such as those with time monitoring hardware. |
| Min Poll | The minimum polling interval, in seconds, as a power of 2. For example, 6 means 2^6, or 64 seconds. The default is 6, minimum value is 4. |
| Max Poll | The maximum polling interval, in seconds, as a power of 2. For example, 10 means 2^10, or 1,024 seconds. The default is 10, maximum value is 17. |
| Force | Forces the addition of the NTP server, even if it is currently unreachable. |

## Boot

**Add**

| | |
|-|-|
| Name | Boot environment name. Alphanumeric characters, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), and periods (`.`) are allowed. |

**Clone**

| | |

| MOTD Banner | The message to show when a user logs in with SSH. |

**Storage**

| | |
|-|-|
| Swap Size in GiB | By default, all data disks are created with the amount of swap specified. Changing the value does not affect the amount of swap on existing disks, only disks added after the change. Does not affect log or cache devices as they are created without swap. Setting to 0 disables swap creation completely. **STRONGLY DISCOURAGED** |
| LOG (Write Cache) Overprovision Size in GiB | Overprovisioning a ZFS Log SSD can increase its performance and lifespan by distributing writes and erases across more drive flash blocks. Defining a number of GiB here overprovisions ZFS Log disks during pool creation or extension. Examples: 50 GiB, 10g, 5GB |

**GUI**

## CAs (Certificate Authorities): Add

**Identifier and Type**

| | |
|-|-|
| Name | Descriptive identifier for this certificate authority. |
| Type | Choose between Internal CA, Intermediate CA, and Import CA. An Internal CA functions like a publicly trusted CA to sign certificates for an internal network. They are not trusted outside the private network. An Intermediate CA lives between the root and end entity certificates and its main purpose is to define and authorize the types of certificates that can be requested from the root CA. Import CA allows an existing CA to be imported onto the system.  For more information see [What are Subordinate CAs and Why Would You Want Your Own?](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-an-intermediate-or-subordinate-certificate-authority) |
| Profiles | Predefined certificate extensions. Choose a profile that best matches your certificate usage scenario. |

**Certificate Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| RSA | See [Why is elliptic curve cryptography not widely used, compared to RSA?](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1190/why-is-elliptic-curve-cryptography-not-widely-used-compared-to-rsa) for more information about key types. |
| Key Length | The number of bits in the key used by the cryptographic algorithm. For security reasons, a minimum key length of 2048 is recommended. |
| Digest Algorithm | The cryptographic algorithm to use. The default SHA256 only needs to be changed if the organization requires a different algorithm. |
| Lifetime | The lifetime of the CA specified in days. |

**Certificate Subject**

| | |
|-|-|
| Country | Select the country of the organization. |
| State | Enter the state or province of the organization. |
| Locality | Enter the location of the organization. For example, the city. |
| Organization | Enter the name of the company or organization. |
| Organizational Unit | Organizational unit of the entity. |
| Email | Enter the email address of the person responsible for the CA. |
| Common Name | Enter the [fully-qualified hostname (FQDN)](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiuv) of the system. This name must be unique within a certificate chain. |
| Subject Alternate Names | Multi-domain support. Enter additional domains to secure. Separate domains by pressing Enter For example, if the primary domain is example.com, entering www.example.com secures both addresses. |

**Basic Constraints**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activate this certificate extension. |
| Path Length | How many non-self-issued intermediate certificates that can follow this certificate in a valid certification path. Entering 0 allows a single additional certificate to follow in the certificate path. Cannot be less than 0. |
| Basic Constraints Config | 
The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject of the certificate is a CA and the maximum depth of valid certification paths that include this certificate.
See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.10](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more information. |

**Authority Key Identifier**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activate this certificate extension. |
| Authority Key Identifier | The authority key identifier extension provides a means of identifying the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign a certificate. This extension is used where an issuer has multiple signing keys (either due to multiple concurrent key pairs or due to changeover). The identification MAY be based on either the key identifier (the subject key identifier in the issuer's certificate) or on the issuer name and serial number.
See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.1](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more information.

**Extended Key Usage**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activate this certificate extension. |
| Usages | Identify the purpose for this public key. Typically used for end entity certificates. Multiple usages can be selected. Do not mark this extension critical when the Usage is ANY_EXTENDED_KEY_USAGE. Using both Extended Key Usage and Key Usage extensions requires that the purpose of the certificate is consistent with both extensions. See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.13](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more details. |
| Critical Extension | Identify this extension as critical for the certificate. Critical extensions must be recognized by the certificate-using system or this certificate will be rejected. Extensions identified as not critical can be ignored by the certificate-using system and the certificate still approved. |

**Key Usage**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activate this certificate extension. |
| Key Usage Config | The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment, signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the certificate. The usage restriction might be employed when a key that could be used for more than one operation is to be restricted. For example, when an RSA key should be used only to verify signatures on objects other than public key certificates and CRLs, the Digital Signature bits would be asserted. Likewise, when an RSA key should be used only for key management, the Key Encipherment bit would be asserted.
See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.3](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more information. |

| | |
|-|-|
| Signing Certificate Authority | Select a previously imported or created CA. |
| Key Type | See [Why is elliptic curve cryptography not widely used, compared to RSA?](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1190/why-is-elliptic-curve-cryptography-not-widely-used-compared-to-rsa) for more information about key types. |
| EC Curve | Brainpool curves can be more secure, while secp curves can be faster. See [Elliptic Curve performance: NIST vs Brainpool](https://tls.mbed.org/kb/cryptography/elliptic-curve-performance-nist-vs-brainpool) for more information. |
| Key Length | The number of bits in the key used by the cryptographic algorithm. For security reasons, a minimum key length of *2048* is recommended. |
| Digest Algorithm | The cryptographic algorithm to use. The default SHA256 only needs to be changed if the organization requires a different algorithm. |
| Lifetime | The lifetime of the CA specified in days. |

**Certificate Subject**

| | |
|-|-|
| Country | Select the country of the organization. |
| State | Enter the state or province of the organization. |
| Locality | Enter the location of the organization. For example, the city. |
| Organization | Enter the name of the company or organization. |
| Organizational Unit | Organizational unit of the entity. |
| Email | Enter the email address of the person responsible for the CA. |
| Common Name | Enter the [fully-qualified hostname (FQDN)](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiuv) of the system. This name must be unique within a certificate chain. |
| Subject Alternate Names | Multi-domain support. Enter additional domains to secure. Separate domains by pressing Enter For example, if the primary domain is example.com, entering www.example.com secures both addresses. |

**Basic Constraints**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activates this certificate extension. |
| Path Length | How many non-self-issued intermediate certificates that can follow this certificate in a valid certification path. Entering `0` allows a single additional certificate to follow in the certificate path. Cannot be less than *0*. |
| Basic Constraints Config | The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject of the certificate is a CA and the maximum depth of valid certification paths that include this certificate.
See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.10](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more information. |

**Authority Key Identifier**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activates this certificate extension. |
| Authority Key Config | The authority key identifier extension provides a means of identifying the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign a certificate. This extension is used where an issuer has multiple signing keys (either due to multiple concurrent key pairs or due to changeover). The identification MAY be based on either the key identifier (the subject key identifier in the issuer's certificate) or on the issuer name and serial number.
See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.1](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more information. |

**Extended Key Usage**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activates this certificate extension. |
| Usages | Identify the purpose for this public key. Typically used for end entity certificates. Multiple usages can be selected. Do not mark this extension critical when the *Usage* is `ANY_EXTENDED_KEY_USAGE`. Using both **Extended Key Usage** and **Key Usage** extensions requires that the purpose of the certificate is consistent with both extensions. See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.13](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more details. |
| Critical Extension | Identify this extension as critical for the certificate. Critical extensions must be recognized by the certificate-using system or this certificate will be rejected. Extensions identified as not critical can be ignored by the certificate-using system and the certificate still approved. |

**Key Usage**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enabled | Activates this certificate extension. |
| Key Usage Config | The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment, signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the certificate. The usage restriction might be employed when a key that could be used for more than one operation is to be restricted. For example, when an RSA key should be used only to verify signatures on objects other than public key certificates and CRLs, the *Digital Signature* bits would be asserted. Likewise, when an RSA key should be used only for key management, the *Key Encipherment* bit would be asserted. See [RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.3](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt) for more information. |

## 2FA (Two Factor Authentication)

**User Settings**

| | |
|-|-|
| One Time Passsword (OTP) Digits | The number of digits in the One-Time Password. The default value is 6, which is the length of the standard OTP from Google. Check the settings of your app or device before selecting this. |
| Interval | The lifespan (in seconds) of each One-Time Password. Default is 30 seconds. The minimum lifetime is 5 seconds. |
| Window | Use Window to extend the validity of passwords beyond the Interval setting. For example, a window setting of 1 means that one password before and after the current one is valid. leaving three valid passwords. Extending the window can be useful in high-latency situations. IMPORTANT: Two-factor authentication is time-based and requires that the system time is set correctly. |
| Enable Two-Factor Auth for SSH | Enable two-factor authentication for SSH access to the system. It is recommended to leave this DISABLED until after two-factor authentication is successfully tested with the UI. |

**System Generated Settings**
